  <h3>Nth Term of Fibonacci Series Demo</h3>
  <p>This is a Python/Django application that will display the Nth number in Fibonacci sequence.
    For instance, if N is 6 and the sequence starts with [1,1..] then it should display ‘8’ as the 6th
    element in the sequence.</p>
  <br>
  <p>It also prints out the time taken to compute this answer.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Also supports complete user management - Sign In/Sign Up, etc.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Method of execution:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Get the Nth term value from user.</li>
    <li>Check if the corresponding value for Nth term already exists in DB, if it does, use it. This elimates the need to compute the value every time even for the same numbers. <b>Improving performance considerably.</b></li>
    <li>If not, compute the value for the input and store it in DB.</li>
    <li>Redirect to answer page and display Value as well as Time Taken.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>API Implementation</h3>
  <p>API exists at the url: <a href="/api/v1/fibonacci/">/api/v1/fibonacci/</a>. This accepts the POST JSON and gives the value and time taken as reponse.</p>
